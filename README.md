# Heart-Disease-Prediction
## Introduction
In this project, a logistic regression model was developed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a dataset containing various features related to cardiovascular health. The data preprocessing phase involved handling missing values, addressing categorical features, and exploring feature correlations. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, With an accuracy of over 80%, the logistic regression model demonstrated its reliability in predicting the probability of heart disease based on the selected features.

# Exploratory Data analysis
The project will involve a large dataset of cardivascular data in which we build a logistic regression model to predict the accurance of heart desease. The data will be cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning analysis.
# Challenges & Learnings
* Understnding dataset.
* Data preprocesing.
* Handing errors / missing values.
* Label encoding.
* Feature scaling.
* predicting.
